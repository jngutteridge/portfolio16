      h3 Description
      p Argento Brass are a brass quintet based in Leicestershire. They formed as an idea between friends and family, sharing a mutual love for brass and music as a whole. Their members have taken their passion for music with them to various universities including the musically acclaimed University of Huddersfield.
      p I was approached by Argento Brass through friends who I knew at secondary school. They had seen my previous work and wanted a website of a similar quality.
      p The website uses beautiful typography from Google Web Fonts, and photography from Red &amp; Silver Media. Argento Brass were a pleasure to work with.
