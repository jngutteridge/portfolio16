      h3 Description
      p Countesthorpe Festival Chorus is an annual opportunity for singers of all ages and abilities to learn and perform a challenging and diverse choral repertoire. They approached me when they were looking for a web presence, and I've been on the committee ever since, managing new media and technology for them.
      p The CFC website provides a hub for singers and listeners alike, somewhere the history of the CFC can be centralised. It includes galleries, past performances, founding friends and a members area, as well as links to registration powerd by Google Forms.
      p The CFC website is a big project that is soon to expand to include a more streamlined design and the inclusion of website posts. Being a part of the CFC is an incredible experience and it's an honour to be part of something that is key to developing skills, enriching lives and building a sense of community.
