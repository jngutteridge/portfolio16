      h3 Description
      p I was approached by a friend to build a website for a photography startup based in Lincoln. Red &amp; Silver Media are a great company to work with, and had already the design ideas in place for me to work with.
      p Initially the website was a flat website that was regularly updated. A few years after launch I converted it into a WordPress website so that they could edit the content as they liked. I also took the opportunity to make the website responsive, something that was difficult to do with such an abstract design.
      p Red &amp; Silver have been great to work with, and we have shared many mutual clients. Using their photos is a joy and really makes any website pop. Good photography is essential to any form of media, and this is especially true for a digital presence.
